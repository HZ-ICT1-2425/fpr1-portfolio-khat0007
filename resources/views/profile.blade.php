                <h1 class="title is-5">About me</h1>
            <p class="para">My name is Shaiza Khatoon, and I am 26 years old. I am from Pakistan, a country that holds a special
                place in my heart. I live in Islamabad, the beautiful capital city surrounded by lush green hills.
                Growing up in Pakistan has given me a deep appreciation for its rich culture, history, and traditions. I
                am proud of my country's diverse landscape, from the towering mountains of the north to the serene
                coastal areas in the south.

                Islamabad is a peaceful city with modern infrastructure and natural beauty, making it a wonderful place
                to live. I enjoy exploring the different parts of my country, from the vibrant streets of Lahore to the
                breathtaking valleys of Swat. The hospitality and warmth of the people in Pakistan are unmatched, and I
                feel fortunate to be part of such a loving community. Pakistan's journey as a nation has had its
                challenges, but I believe in its potential and bright future. I am grateful for the opportunity to
                contribute to its development in my own way. </p>


            <p class="para">My childhood dream was to become an IT expert, as I have always been fascinated by technology and its
                potential to transform lives. When I received the opportunity to go abroad and continue my studies, I
                didn't hesitate to avail it. I knew it was a chance to broaden my horizons and dive deeper into the
                world of information and communication technology (ICT). Coming from Pakistan, I have always believed in
                the importance of education, and this opportunity to study in a different country has opened up a world
                of possibilities for me.

                I am here to pursue my further studies in ICT, which I believe will equip me with the skills and
                knowledge to make a real difference in the field. The ever-evolving nature of technology excites me, and
                I am passionate about exploring areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science.
                Studying abroad has also given me the chance to experience diverse cultures and learn from experts in
                the field, which will surely help me grow both personally and professionally. My goal is to return to
                Pakistan and contribute to its technological advancements, helping bridge the digital divide and
                creating innovative solutions for my country. </p>
