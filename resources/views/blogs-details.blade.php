        <h1 class="title is-2 mt-2">Study Choice</h1>
        <p>
            The increasing role of Technology in shaping the modren world has also played a significant role in
            motivating
            my study choice,I realize this by studing ICT.From an early age I was drawn to computer and technology and I
            knew that this was the field where I wanted
            to make an impact.Activities like coding,problem solving and learning about new technologies have always
            sparkled my intrest, which reinforced my decision to choose ICT as my acadmic path .And I hope that my
            education
            will allow me to not only fullfill my
            dreams and goals but also gives back to my country and help bridge the technology gap in Pakistan , and also
            I
            apply my knowledgein practical ways.

        <h3>My programing experience</h3>
        <p3>I have some programming experience, primarily in C++, which I gained through online courses and self-study
            in my
            home country. These courses provided a solid foundation in basic programming concepts, such as variables,
            loops,
            conditionals, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a core feature of C++.
            Additionally, I
            supplemented my learning by reading various books on programming and computer science, allowing me to dive
            deeper into algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. My initial goal was to become an IT
            expert, which fueled my passion for learning more about coding and software development. However, due to
            circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to pursue formal education or a career in IT, leading me to
            choose
            another field. Despite this, my interest in technology has remained, and I continue to nurture my
            programming
            skills whenever possible, believing that the knowledge and experience I've gained will always serve me in
            some
            capacity, whether professionally or personally. I am still deeply motivated by the ever-evolving tech
            industry
            and the possibilities it offers, which keeps my passion for programming alive.
