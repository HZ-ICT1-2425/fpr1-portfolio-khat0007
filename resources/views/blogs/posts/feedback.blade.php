            No redundant code, well structured, good use of indenting, Capitalization, and professional naming
            conventions of code and files.

            I received feedback from the teacher's assistant and students about my dashboard design. Some suggested
            making changes, while others said it looked amazing. This left me feeling confused about what to do next.
            I need to carefully consider the feedback and decide whether to improve the design or keep it as it is.
            My goal is to create a dashboard that works well for everyone.
