            No redundant code, well structured, good use of indenting, Capitalization, and professional naming
            conventions of code and files.

            I received feedback from the teacher's assistant and students about my dashboard design.
            Some people suggested making changes to improve it, while others said it looked amazing as it is.
            This mixed feedback left me feeling a bit confused about what to do next. On one hand, I want to
            make improvements based on suggestions, but on the other hand, I don’t want to change something
            that is already working well for some users. I need to carefully analyze the comments and identify
            which changes would truly enhance the dashboard. It’s important to balance aesthetics, functionality,
            and user experience. I also want to ensure that any modifications align with the original purpose of
            the dashboard. Considering the diverse opinions, I might test different versions to see what works best.
            My ultimate goal is to create a dashboard that is both visually appealing and highly functional for everyone who uses it.
